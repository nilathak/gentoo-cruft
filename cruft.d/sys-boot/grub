#When you do not have a boot partition and /boot is a directory on
#the / (root) partiton, the pathname to your kernel is /boot/kernel-...
#and the root (hdx,y) statement points to your / (root) partition.
#Now everything works as expected.
#
#When you have a real boot, the root (hdx,y) statement points to
#the boot partition and a kernel at /boot/kernel-... will not be
#found as the path /boot does not exist. As the filesystem tree is
#not assembled when grub boots the system, you can't point root
#(hd,x,y) to / as /boot is not attached.
#
#The solution is a symlink called boot, pointing to itself (.) so
#the kernel can still be at /boot/kernel-..., but now the symlink
#is used to satisfy the reference to /boot.
